# Project Setup and Instructions

In the project directory, you can run:

---

### `cd backend && python test.py`

Starts the backend with the trained Python model. 

Before running, ensure you have Python installed and all required libraries by executing:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


This command serves the trained model for backend processing. Ensure that the model files and dependencies are properly configured.

cd backend && node server.js
Starts the Node.js server, which acts as the backend for the login page or other API-based interactions.

Before starting, make sure to install all necessary dependencies by running:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Once started, the server will handle API requests and interact with the Python model or the database.

Additional Notes
Python Backend

Run python test.py before starting the Node.js server to ensure the backend is ready.
If you encounter errors, confirm that all dependencies in requirements.txt are installed.
Node.js Server

Use tools like nodemon for easier development with automatic server restarts.
Ensure the port used in server.js is not already in use.
Your project is now ready to run both the Python backend and the Node.js server for a seamless experience! ðŸŽ‰
